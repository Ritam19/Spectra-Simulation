# Spectra-Simulation
This is a simple program that has a purpose to simulate simple specyrum by giving a list of vertical excitation energies and oscillation strengths.
After execution of the program, a spectrum can be obtained by plotting E x sigma(E)

To run the program, all the files are prepared and given as an example, only the values should be modified.
All the steps are explained in the beginning of the code (spectra_simulation.py) and in the Sepctra simulation pdf.
