# Spectra-Simulation
This is a simple program that has a purpose to simulate simple specyrum by giving a list of vertical excitation energies and oscillation strengths.
After execution of the program, a spectrum can be obtained by plotting E x sigma(E)

To run the program, all the files are prepared and given as an example, only the values should be modified.
To run it , all the steps are explained in the beginning of the program and in the Sepctra simulation pdf.
