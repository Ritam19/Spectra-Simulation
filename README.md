# Spectra-Simulation
This is a simple program that has a purpose to simulate simple specyrum by giving a list of vertical excitation energies and oscillation strengths.
After execution of the program, a spectrum can be obtained by plotting E x sigma(E)

To run the program, a spectra_simulation.py file is the main code file.
All the files needed, are prepared and given as an example (inp.py,energies_forces.py,gamma.dat,delta.dat), only the values should be modified.
The steps to run it are explained in the beginning of the code file (spectra_simulation.py) and in the Sepctra simulation pdf.
